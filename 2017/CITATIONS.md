> Techno music reflects what is inside of you without giving you any ideas on its own. It is inside of you. And that is what makes it great. I never have thoughts about movies, video games or anything else when listening to techno music. It is like white noise to me. It helps me to relocate my thoughts and be who I am.

To make an analogy with visual arts, Techno is often appreciated more like design or architecture than it is like painting. Unlike song-based popular music Techno doesn’t address you as if it is speaking to you or relating a narrative but rather surrounds you with a sonic space which has characteristics you can relate to as you would to the experience of a physical space, possibly one that you’re travelling through. Melody, harmony and short structures (verse / chorus) are not the focus whereas tone, texture and rhythm are.

> The qualities that people value in Techno music are often quite different from those appreciated in other forms of popular music. If you’re hearing good techno music and finding that you don’t appreciate it then it’s possibly to do with how you’re listening and what your expectations are regarding musical value. When I was new to Techno music it took quite a bit of time to become familiar with how to listen to it and be able to make judgments about its musical qualities. It can be radically different to other popular music.
